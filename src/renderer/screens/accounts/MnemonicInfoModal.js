            Your mnemonic is a special secret created for you by Ganache. It's used to generate the addresses available during development as well as sign transactions sent from those addresses.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should only use this mnemonic during development. If you use a wallet application configured with this mnemonic, ensure you switch to a separate configuration when using that wallet with production blockchains.
          </p>
          <p>
            This mnemonic is not secure. You should not trust it to manage blockchain assets.
